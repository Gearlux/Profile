### Task
The main goal of this project is to assist the radiographers in their workflow while taking X-Ray images. Because the experience of the radiographers has reduced the last decades, I saw the opportunity for Agfa to implement a program to raise the knowledge bar and assist the radiographers in their daily work with [SmartXR](https://medimg.agfa.com/main/direct-radiography/smartxr/).

### Action
After a prioritization round, the first four pillars for SmartXR were determined. This included the estimation of risk, effort and value from a large set of features. Collaboration with universities for the different topics were set up, work was divided across multiple teams and development followed up. With custom trello scripts, overview gantt charts are created combining all phases, steps and projects.

### Result
The result of this project was one of the largest successful product launches of Agfa. The project is now the core of new features being implemented to further assist and automate the workflow of the radiographer. 

### Responsibilities
Project Planning, Software Architect, Researcher
